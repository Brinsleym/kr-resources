## **Basic Grammar Points**

### **1\. Possessive Particle \~의 (of / 's)**

* \~의 is attached to a noun to show possession, similar to 's in English or の in Japanese.  
* **Pronunciation**: While written as ui, in this possessive case, it's often pronounced as 에 (e).  
* **Examples**:  
  * **나의 (나에)**: my (casual)  
  * **너의 (너에)**: your (casual)  
  * **저의 (저에)**: my (formal)  
  * **우리의 (우리에)**: our (casual)  
  * **저희의 (저희에)**: our (formal/humble)

### **2\. Connectors for "And"**

There are several ways to connect nouns with "and."

* **\~와 / \~과 (to)**  
  * A more formal or written-style connector.  
  * Use **\~과** after a noun ending in a **consonant** (e.g., 물**과** \- water and).  
  * Use **\~와** after a noun ending in a **vowel** (e.g., 바나나**와** \- banana and).  
* **\~랑 / \~이랑 (ya)**  
  * A more common and conversational connector.  
  * Use **\~이랑** after a noun ending in a **consonant** (e.g., 핸드폰**이랑** \- phone and).  
  * Use **\~랑** after a noun ending in a **vowel** (e.g., 치마**랑** \- skirt and).  
* **\~하고**  
  * A very common and neutral connector, usable in both speech and writing. It can be attached to any noun, regardless of whether it ends in a vowel or consonant. (e.g., 선풍기**하고** 필통 \- fan and pencil case).

#### **3\. Titles for Names**

* **\~씨**: The equivalent of Mr./Ms./Mrs. (like 〜さん in Japanese). It's a standard polite title attached after a person's full name or first name.  
* **\~님**: A more honorific title than \~씨 (like 〜様 in Japanese). It is used for people in respected positions (e.g., 선생님 \- teacher) or for customers to show a high level of respect.
