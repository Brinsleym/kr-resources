Korean follows the SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order pattern:

- Subject (S) + Object (O) + Verb (V)

This is different from English which follows SVO order:

| **Language** | **Word Order** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Korean | SOV | "I apple eat." |
| English | SVO | "I eat apple." |

Key point: In Korean, the verb always comes at the end of the sentence.

## Korean Particles

## Topic Particle: 은/는

Used to introduce or contrast a topic - shows what the sentence is about.

- 은: used with nouns ending with 받침 (batchim/final consonant)
- 는: used with nouns ending without 받침

Example: 물(water)은 (with batchim), 너(you)는 (without batchim)

Note: When using a name with batchim, you must use 이는 (e.g., 채원이는)

## Subject Marker: 이/가

Shows who or what is performing the action (the subject).

- 이: used with nouns ending with 받침
- 가: used with nouns ending without 받침

Example: With batchim - 채원이가, Without batchim - 유미가

## Object Marker: 을/를

Indicates the object of a verb - the thing receiving the action.

- 을: used with nouns ending with 받침
- 를: used with nouns ending without 받침
