---

These notes cover politeness levels, demonstratives (this/that), essential question words, and basic vocabulary for objects, places, and jobs.

### 1. Politeness Levels: 존댓말 (Formal) vs. 반말 (Casual)

Korean speech changes depending on who you are talking to. Understanding the difference between polite and casual forms is essential.

* **존댓말:** Polite Speech.
    * Used with people you've met for the first time, elders, superiors (bosses, teachers), or in formal settings.
    * Often ends in `~요 (~yo)` or `~입니다 (~imnida)`.
* **반말:** Casual Speech.
    * Used with close friends, family, and people younger than you.
    * Often has shorter, more direct endings.

| Expression Type | Formal (존댓말) | Casual (반말) | English Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Greeting** | 안녕하세요 | 안녕 | Hello / Hi |
| **Thanks** | 감사합니다 / 고맙습니다 / 고마워요 | 고마워 | Thank you / Thanks |
| **Apology** | 죄송합니다 / 미안합니다 / 미안해요 | 미안해 | I'm sorry / Sorry |
| **Asking "How are you?"** | 잘 지내요? | 잘 지내? | How are you? |
| **Saying Goodbye** | 안녕히 가세요 / 안녕히 계세요 | 잘가 / 잘 있어 | Goodbye / Bye |

**Key Goodbye Phrases:**
* **안녕히 계세요:** Literally "Stay in peace." You say this when **YOU** are leaving. The other person is staying.
* **안녕히 가세요:** Literally "Go in peace." You say this when **THE OTHER PERSON** is leaving. You are staying.

### 2. Demonstratives: This, That, and That Over There

These words are used to point out objects. They are the Korean equivalents of "this," "that," and "that over there."

| Korean | Japanese Meaning | English Meaning & Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **이거** | これ | **This** (thing near the speaker). |
| **그거** | それ | **That** (thing near the listener). |
| **저거** | あれ | **That** (thing far from both speaker and listener).  |

* **Note:** These are contractions. The full forms are **이것 (igeot)**, **그것 (geugeot)**, and **저것 (jeogeot)**. The contractions are much more common in conversation.

| **뭐예요?** | **뭐야?** | What is it? |
| **얼마예요?** | **얼마야?** | How much is it? |
